How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed me the differences between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
In this way I can understand why did I make some specific changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Is better because it gives me the control.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because it was designed for programers.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can track all the changes using git log and get to know what was the particular change using git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I will always be able to go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use it for a new project that Im working on.
