When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For security purposes, redundancy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I dont want to upload changes until they are ready to go public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are branches that are in github servers. Clones are branches that had been cloned whether from a remote or a local repository.
